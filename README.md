# **Price Scale-Based Bias Trading System**

## **Overview**

The **Price Scale-Based Bias Trading System** aims to improve the consistency and accuracy of price-based trading by stabilizing price movements. This system adjusts the price data by removing volatile decimal parts of the price, making it easier to focus on larger, more significant market shifts. The primary goal is to avoid trading in range-bound markets and instead capture larger price movements when the price shifts substantially, based on key price levels.

By rounding prices to significant levels (such as 84,000 instead of 84,899.99), the system filters out the smaller fluctuations and focuses on major price shifts. The use of dynamic bias adjustment helps identify trends more reliably, avoiding issues such as overfitting or over-reliance on constantly changing data points.

## **Key Features**

- **Dynamic Rounding:** The system adjusts price data based on the magnitude of the asset's price. For example, prices greater than 10,000 are rounded to the nearest 1,000, while smaller prices are rounded to the nearest 0.1. This stabilizes price movements by removing volatility caused by decimals.
  
- **Bias Adjustment:** The system calculates a dynamic bias based on the price magnitude. This bias helps to capture trends more effectively by creating a small offset in price, which ensures trades are initiated based on significant price shifts rather than minor fluctuations.

- **Focus on Major Trends:** The system is designed to identify and trade major price movements (crossovers between rounded prices) rather than reacting to small, random price changes. This is achieved by rounding prices and adjusting based on the magnitude, ensuring that trades are initiated only when the price crosses significant levels.

- **Ranging Market Filter:** By rounding prices and ignoring small decimal movements, the system avoids trading in markets where price fluctuations are constrained within a narrow range. This ensures that the trades placed are based on clear, larger trends.

## **How It Works**

1. **Dynamic Rounding Function:**
   - The price is rounded based on the magnitude of the asset. For example, if the price is 84,899.99, it will be rounded down to 84,000 to avoid reacting to minor fluctuations.
   - Prices are adjusted to the nearest 10, 100, 1,000, or 0.1, depending on their magnitude.

2. **Bias Calculation:**
   - A dynamic bias is applied based on the price magnitude to help capture trends early. The bias is higher for larger prices and lower for smaller prices.

3. **Trade Entry Conditions:**
   - The system monitors the crossover between the 10-minute close (adjusted with dynamic rounding and bias) and the 1-day VWAP (also adjusted with dynamic rounding). A bullish crossover triggers a long entry, and a bearish crossunder triggers a short entry.

4. **Avoid Range-bound Markets:**
   - By focusing on rounded price levels, the system avoids trading within narrow ranges (e.g., between 84,000 and 83,000) and only trades when the price crosses significant price levels.

## **Script Usage**

- This script is designed for use in **TradingView**, and it's meant to be used as a tool to help filter out smaller, less meaningful price movements while focusing on larger trends.
  
- It is ideal for traders who want to avoid the noise of small fluctuations and focus on the major movements in the market.
